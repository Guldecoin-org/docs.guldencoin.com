## Jenkins
A [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) setup is running at [ci.guldencoin.com](https://ci.guldencoin.com). It is responsible for updating the [docs](/services/docs), [cdn](/services/cdn), and building+testing code.

## Top menu & service page.
The most important guldencoin service sites are linked in the navigation bar on top of those sites. Since it's not possible for mobile devices to display all links, there's a small static webpage hosted at [service.guldencoin.com](https://service.guldencoin.com). It's meant as a 'menu' for all services/tools. The navbar on mobile devices links to that webpage.
