Basically, by including a single css file into any website, the character <span style='font-family:"proxima-nova", "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif !important;'>Ġ</span> is converted to a Guldencoin valuta sign: `Ġ`.

## Usage

To use the guldensign, include a single css file into your source code and use the <span style='font-family:"proxima-nova", "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif !important;'>Ġ</span> character. Alternatively, use the html character code `&Gdot;` or `&#288;`.

To include the guldencoin.css fiel, either [download](https://github.com/nlgcoin/guldensign/archive/master.zip) the latest files from the [github repository](https://github.com/nlgcoin/guldensign) and include then in your source tree. Then include guldensign.css in your html.
Or simply use the [cdn](/services/cdn) to include guldensign.css:

`<link href="//nlgcdn.com/guldensign/1/guldensign.css" rel="stylesheet">`
