Basically, by including a single css file into any website, the character `{{% html <span style='font-family:Verdana;'>Ġ</span> %}}` is converted to a Guldencoin valuta sign: `Ġ`.

## Usage

Include a css file into your source code and use the `Ġ` character

Either [download](https://github.com/nlgcoin/guldensign/archive/master.zip) the files from the [github repository](https://github.com/nlgcoin/guldensign) and include then in your source tree. Then include guldensign.css in your html.
Or simply use the [cdn](/services/cdn) to include guldensign.css:

`<link href="//nlgcdn.com/guldensign/1/guldensign.css" rel="stylesheet">`

## Credits
The guldensign font files are created with [fontforge](http://fontforge.org/).
