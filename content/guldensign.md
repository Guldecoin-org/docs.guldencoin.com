The guldensign is a valuta sign like the dollar `$` and euro `&euro;` signs. 
Because the Guldencoin valuta sign is not a UTF-8 character, a drop-in css 'workarround' has been created for websites. The character <span style='font-family:"proxima-nova", "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif !important;'>Ġ</span> is displayed as a Guldencoin valuta sign: Ġ

When using the sign, there's no need to add a space between the sign and the amount. Example: Ġ100.50

## Usage

To use the guldensign in websites, include a single css file into your html and use the <span style='font-family:"proxima-nova", "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif !important;'>Ġ</span> character. Alternatively, use the html character code `&Gdot;` or `&#288;`.
